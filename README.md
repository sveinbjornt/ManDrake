# ManDrake

***This software does not run on latest macOS versions and is no longer maintained. Caveat emptor!***

ManDrake is a native <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">man page</a> editor for macOS with features such as syntax highlighting, live <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandoc">`mandoc`</a> syntax validation and a live-updating rendered preview of the man page during editing. It can also export man pages as PDF or HTML.

Long story short, many years ago I was sick of writing man pages in an endless cycle of edit-view, edit-view so I decided to do something about it and created this editor. It's a bit rough around the edges, but it works really well for me. Perhaps it will also be of some use to you.

## Building ManDrake

### Requirements

If you want to build ManDrake yourself, you need the following components/tools:

* Apple's Xcode
* macOS SDK (10.8 or later)
* Git
* [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

You may also need to install Xcode’s command line tools with the following command, if you want to re-build the included `cat2html` and `mandoc` binaries

    xcode-select --install

### Environment Setup

After cloning the repository, run the following commands inside the repository root (i.e. the directory containing this `README.md` file):

    pod install

This installs all the dependencies required. ManDrake can then be built via the `xcworkspace`.

## Captain Mandrake

> **Do I look all rancid and clotted? You look at me, Jack. Eh? Look, eh? And I drink a lot of water, you know. I'm what you might call a water man, Jack - that's what I am. And I can swear to you, my boy, swear to you, that there's nothing wrong with my bodily fluids. Not a thing, Jackie.**

Here's **Group Captain Lionel Mandrake** from Kubrick's wonderful [*Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/) in the intimidating company of Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper.
